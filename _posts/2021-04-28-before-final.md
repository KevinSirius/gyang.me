Hi everyone.

It has been so long since I last updated my site. A lot of stuff is changing.

For Cachecash, we are rewriting the codebase with python now. It will not run as fast as golang (of course) but for the sake of readability, we have to use a more intuitive language at this moment with better comments and documentations. A lot of structures have to change because of the lack of channel and thread support in python, but we will figure it out once we have some time.

BTW, since I am graduating next semester, I surprisingly found myself not so hateful towards school now. It's amazing. Please don't change me back in the next two weeks.

I am not doing the todo list project now because I ran into Notion. I use it for everything now and I am more than happy about it. I made my first build of my own todo list and the moment I learned how to use Notion I literally cried for a second. It is more than my expectations. Good job.

Oh yeh I was recruited to be the SWE intern at MarketAxess. It's a fintech company and I really want to try it out. I have been learning finance courses for two years now and frankly they bored me hard. Only the mathematical models are interesting like GARCH and so on. Can't wait to apply my knowledge in Machine Learning and finance models to a trading program. I might open a gofundme project when that happens because my debit account won't allow me to take the risk of market.

I have been thinking more stuff in social science than computer science. I was reading a book regarding the money flow in the world and for a quick second I thought capital inheritance should not be a thing. I was shocked by the thought because of its socialism core but it intrigued me to read more into capitalism and communism. 

Anyway, life has been good. My cat has been taking care of me really well.

I will see you in the summer.
